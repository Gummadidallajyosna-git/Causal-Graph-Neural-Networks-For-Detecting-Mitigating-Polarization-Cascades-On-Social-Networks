# Causal-Graph-Neural-Networks-For-Detecting-Mitigating-Polarization-Cascades-On-Social-Networks

This project implements a Causal Graph Neural Network (C-GNN) to detect and reduce polarization in social networks. Using Python, PyTorch, and NetworkX, the model learns user relationships and estimates causal effects between sentiment, activity, and ideology. It accurately identifies polarized communities and suggests interventions to balance information flow across users.
